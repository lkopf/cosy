Avoid vague or abstract themes like 'diversity', 'context', or 'life'. For example, do not use 'animal' but specify what kind of animal or characteristics of the animal. Focus on visible entities (objects, creatures, materials, or actions). Output only the final concept that occurs in all images, no other text.
